        I am not the only traveler
        Who has not repaid his debt
        I've been searching for a trail to follow again
        Take me back to the night we met
        And then I can tell myself
        What the hell I'm supposed to do
        And then I can tell myself
        Not to ride along with you
        I had all and then most of you
        Some and now none of you
        Take me back to the night we met
        I don't know what I'm supposed to do
        Haunted by the ghost of you
        Oh, take me back to the night we met
        When the night was full of terrors
        And your eyes were filled with tears
        When you had not touched me yet
        Oh, take me back to the night we met
        I had all and then most of you
        Some and now none of you
        Take me back to the night we met
        I don't know what I'm supposed to do
        Haunted by the ghost of you
        Take me back to the night we met
